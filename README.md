Jupyter Notebooks for MAT201 dynamics content in Python (JT 2022)

The undergraduate MAT201 Applied Mathematics course at Abertay University comprises of several topics. The dynamics content, in particular, requires students solve differential/integral equations to verify the kinematic behaviour of objects. While the aim of MAT201 is to familiarise students with the mathematics behind many of these topics, students may benefit from seeing this mathematics *in action*. 

These codes are for additional context once students are able to carry out the mathematical steps: the ultimate goal is that students are able to mathematical problems in future, using whatever software or coding language is necessary. 
These notebooks should NOT be used in the exam or replace students use of a pen and paper approach to tutorial problems. However, students *are* encouraged to use these codes to verify their tutorial solutions after they have already been solved using pen and paper.

Several notebooks are adapted directly from examples shown in Allen B. Downey's "Modeling and Simulation in Python" Free Book (available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license, see https://allendowney.github.io/ModSimPy/# for more details and examples).

Another useful resource (including interactive examples) is Python Programming And Numerical Methods: A Guide 
For Engineers And Scientists, found at https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html (February 2022), though not directly used in the notebooks created here.

The augmentation of this course with interactive Jupyter notebooks is still *in development*, so feedback and comments/suggestions are welcome.
